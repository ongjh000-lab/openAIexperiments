# openAIexperiments
A repo which documents my experimentations and learnings with OpenAI features (eg GPT, Codex and agents) as a non-technical layperson to understand how to usefully, safely, and efficiently use AI to unlock personal and professional productivity. Please bear with me as I write imperfect code.

The goal is to practice and familiarise myself with the agentic tools available. I aim to help startups and product teams ship agentic AI faster by aligning engineering, risk, and business decisions, and putting practical governance and controls in place to reduce compliance rework.
