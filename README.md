# openAIexperiments
A repo which documents my experimentations with OpenAI features (eg GPT, Codex and agents) as a non-technical layperson to understand how to usefully, safely, and efficiently use AI to unlock personal and professional productivity. 

I cut my teeth in maritime/climate policy and risk, where ambiguity is the job and I translated complex climate engineering technologies for companies and lawmakers. 
Now I aim to do AI technology translation that aligns engineers, risk, and business—so you get decision clarity, faster execution, and AI that survives real-world constraints.
