# openAIexperiments
A repo which documents my experimentations with OpenAI features (eg GPT, Codex and agents) as a non-technical layperson to understand how to usefully, safely, and efficiently use AI to unlock personal and professional productivity. I aim to align engineers, risk, and business to get faster execution and AI that survives real-world constraints.
